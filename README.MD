    <h4>blacketv2 replacement for betastar.js</h4>
</div>
<h1>Hello, and welcome to Trtl!</h1>
<p>
Trtl was designed as an "updated" betastar.js - one that has even more functions, but still holds to the same true purpose - chatbots and  modification.
<br>
Trtl works with BlacketV2, not Betastar.
</p>
<h2>Quick notice: For anyone wondering, this was NOT developed out of anger or grudge- I made this in order to allow people to make bots, and express creative freedom in blacket-based projects they're making.</h2>
