    <h3>trtl</h3>
    <h4>blacketv2 replacement for betastar.js</h4>
</div>
<h1>Hello, and welcome to Trtl!</h1>
<p>
    Trtl was designed as an "updated" betastar.js - one that has even more functions, but still holds to the same true
    purpose - chatbots and modification.
    <br>
    Trtl works with BlacketV2, not Betastar.
</p>

<h2>Quick notice: For anyone wondering, this was NOT developed out of anger or grudge- I made this in order to allow
    people to make bots, and express creative freedom in blacket-based projects they're making.</h2>

<h1>As proven in Betastar, making bots with malicious purposes can result in a ban. Create wisely.</h1>
