    <h3>trtl</h3>
    <h4>blacketv2 replacement for betastar.js</h4>
</div>
<h1>Hello, and welcome to Trtl!</h1>
<p>
    Trtl was designed as an "updated" betastar.js - one that has even more functions, but still holds to the same true
    purpose - chatbots and modification.
    <br>
    Trtl works with BlacketV2, not Betastar.
</p>

<h2>Quick notice: For anyone wondering, this was NOT developed out of anger or grudge- I made this in order to allow
    people to make bots, and express creative freedom in blacket-based projects they're making.</h2>

<h1>As proven in Betastar, making bots with malicious purposes can result in a ban. Create wisely. Even boths that don't have malicious intent may sometimes be muted or banned. The creators of trtl are in no way responsible for what happens because of your bot.</h1>
